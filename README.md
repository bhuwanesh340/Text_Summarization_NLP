Used Elbow, Silhouette and Gaps Statistics for Text Summarization

The quantity  of  information on the internet is massively  increasing  and  gigantic  volume  of  data  with numerous compositions accessible openly online become more widespread. It is challenging nowadays for a user to extract the information efficiently and smoothly. 

As one of  the  methods  to  tackle  this  challenge,  text summarization  process  diminishes  the  redundant information  and  retrieves  the  useful  and  relevant information from a text document to form a compressed and shorter version which is easy to understand and timesaving  while  reflecting  the  main  idea  of  the  discussed topic within the document.  

The approaches  of automatic text  summarization  earn  a  keen  interest  within  the  Text Mining  and  NLP  (Natural  Language  Processing) communities  because  it  is  a  laborious  job  to  manually summarize a text document. 

Mainly there are two types of  text  summarization,  namely  extractive  based  and abstractive  based.  

Here  the  extractive based summarization using K-Means Clustering with TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for summarization. The methods also reflects the idea of true K and  using  that  value  of  K  divides  the  sentences  of  the 
input document to present the final summary.
